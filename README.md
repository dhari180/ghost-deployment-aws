# Infrastructure and CI/CD Setup using Terraform, AWS ECS, and AWS Developer Tools


This project sets up an AWS infrastructure to deploy a containerized GHOST application using Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate for running containers without managing servers, and a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS developer tools.

# Infrastructure Overview:
The infrastructure is defined in Terraform and includes the following components:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Custom virtual network space in AWS.

Subnets: Network subdivisions designed for public and private access.

Internet Gateway (IGW): Provides access to the internet from AWS VPC.

NAT Gateway: Allows instances in private subnets to access the internet while remaining private.

Route Tables: Define rules to determine where network traffic is directed.

ECS Cluster: A cluster to manage ECS services and tasks.

ECS Task Definition and Service: Defines the application to run and maintains the desired count of instances of the application.

ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Docker container registry to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.

CloudWatch Log Group: Used for logging the output and errors from the ECS tasks.

IAM Roles and Policies: Provides necessary permissions for ECS tasks and services.

Load Balancer (LB) with Listener and Target Group: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, in multiple Availability Zones.

Security Groups: Acts as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

# CI/CD Overview:
The CI/CD pipeline is built using AWS developer tools to automate the deployment process:

AWS CodeCommit: Stores the application code and the Terraform configuration.

AWS CodeBuild: Compiles the code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy.

AWS CodeDeploy: Automates application deployments to Amazon ECS.

AWS CodePipeline: Orchestrates the workflow of the CI/CD process, connecting CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

# Best Practices Incorporated

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Using Terraform for predictable deployments.

Module Structure: Organizing infrastructure into modules for reusability and manageability.

Version Control: All infrastructure code and application code are version controlled in AWS CodeCommit.

Continuous Integration: Every change is automatically built, and tests are run using AWS CodeBuild.

Continuous Deployment: Automated deployment using AWS CodeDeploy, ensuring that the latest version is always running.

Rolling Updates: AWS ECS and CodeDeploy allow for rolling updates to minimize downtime.

Security: Least privilege access via IAM roles and security groups.

High Availability: Resources are spread across multiple Availability Zones.

Scalability: Use of AWS Fargate to allow easy scaling of containers.

Monitoring and Logging: Using AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring of the infrastructure and application.

Load Balancing: AWS Load Balancer ensures the distribution of traffic and fault tolerance.

Backup and Restore: State files are stored in an S3 bucket for recovery and historical purposes.

# All infrastructure can be deployed using deploy.yml worflow triggered on push/merge request.
